      Imagine the following: You need to make a choice between two hotels on a booking platform for your holiday stay.
      Both hotels are equally preferable to you with respect to cost, location, facilities, services, etc. <br />
      Other users' ratings are aggregated and summarized by their number of ratings, the mean of their ratings, their distribution
      over the different rating values as well as by the origin of ratings (i.e. if the ratings were based on all users or from users similar to you).<br />
      Given the above, which of the two hotels below would you choose when you were to solely consider the ratings of the two accomodations
