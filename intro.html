      Imagine the following: You need to make a choice between six hotels on a booking platform for your holiday stay.
      All hotels are equally preferable to you with respect to cost, location, facilities, services, etc. <br />
      Other users' ratings are aggregated and summarized by their number of ratings, the mean of their ratings, their distribution
      over the different rating values.<br />
      Given the above information, how would you rank each one of the six hotels, choosing ranks from 1 to 6,
      when you were to solely consider the aggregated<br/> ratings of the six accomodation facilities.
